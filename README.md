4. Attack Types: Bombings and armed assaults are the primary tactics used in these incidents, underlining the use of explosives and firearms as common strategies.

5. Targeted Groups: Civilians and private property are the most frequent targets of terrorism, followed by soldiers. This emphasizes the impact on innocent lives and the complex security challenges.

6. Terrorist Groups: The Taliban stands out as the most active group, indicating their widespread influence in many incidents.

7. Motive Complexity: In many cases, the motive behind terrorism incidents remains unknown, highlighting the multifaceted nature of these acts.

8. Group Activities: Most terrorism incidents are carried out by groups, emphasizing the collaborative nature of these activities.
